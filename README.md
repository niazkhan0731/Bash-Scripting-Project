# Bash Shell Scripting Project: The Matrix
Our instructor gave us a challenge to create anything we wanted using the power of Bash Shell Scripting. Here are the step-by-step instructions on how we created this awesome game. Feel free to copy the script from the "<b>matrix.sh</b>" file above and try it out for yourself in your VIM/Nano text editor.

## Instructions:
<b>Step 1:</b> First open your Bash terminal and install a program called <b>cmatrix</b> by typing the command <b><i>sudo apt-get install cmatrix</b></i>.

<b>Step 2:</b> Now type the command <b><i>which zenity</b></i> to see if you have Zenity installed. If you don't have it in your Bash, type the command <b><i>sudo apt-get install zenity</b></i> to install it.

<b>Step 3:</b> Once that's sucessfully installed create a file called <b>matrix.sh</b> by typing the command <b><i>vim matrix.sh</b></i>.

<b>Step 4:</b> Open the script I have in this repository called <b>matrix.sh</b> then copy and paste the script into your text editor. Press esc to go back into command mode and type <b><i>:wq</b></i> to save and exit.

<b>Step 5:</b> Back in the CLI, give execute access to the user for the script file by typing in the command <b><i>chmod 700 matrix.sh</b></i>

<b>Step 5:</b> Lastly, execute the script file by typing <b><i>./matrix.sh</b></i> and enjoy the game! ðŸ˜Š
