# Bash Shell Scripting Project: The Matrix
Our instructor at Per Scholas gave us a challenge to create anything we wanted using the power of Bash Shell Scripting. Here are the step-by-step instructions on how to deploy this awesome game. Feel free to copy the script from the "matrix.sh" file above and try it out for yourself in your Vim/Nano text editor.

## Instructions:
<b>Step 1:</b> First, open your Bash terminal and install a program called <b>cmatrix</b> by typing the command <b><i>sudo apt-get install cmatrix</i></b>.

<b>Step 2:</b> Now, type the command <b><i>which zenity</i></b> to see if you have Zenity installed. If you don't have it in your Bash, type the command <b><i>sudo apt-get install zenity</i></b> to install it.

<b>Step 3:</b> Once that's successfully installed, create a file called <b>matrix.sh</b> by typing the command <b><i>vim matrix.sh</i></b>.

<b>Step 4:</b> Open the script I have in this repository called <b>matrix.sh</b>, then copy and paste the script into your text editor. Press "esc" to go back into command mode and type <b><i>:wq</i></b> to save and exit.

<b>Step 5:</b> Back in the CLI, give read, write, and execute access to the owner for the script file by typing the command <b><i>chmod 700 matrix.sh</i></b>.

<b>Step 6:</b> Lastly, execute the script file by typing <b><i>./matrix.sh</i></b> and enjoy the game! ðŸ˜Š</b>
